# Alain Lemaire

Wandering problem-solver, critical-thinker and perpetual student. I've spent the past five years empowering people through technology and, along the way, helped revolutionize how humanitarian aid organizations understand, access and use information. After [Felix Baumgartner](https://youtu.be/FHtvDA0W34I?t=1m)'ing into the world of software development, I'm searching for an organization that cares about software craftsmanship, that demands the best of what I know and drives me to learn more of everything I don't, so that we all succeed in reaching the next level.

## Skills

#### Mobile and Web Development
* Through an intensive, sixteen-week bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), I've built a strong foundation in agile software development, with a focus on testing, object-oriented programming and code cleanliness.
* I have experience with SOLID OOP in both Ruby and JavaScript across a range of application interfaces, from minimalist CLIs to dynamic frontends and RESTful APIs.
* An enthusiastic autodidact, I can pick up unfamiliar languages and frameworks quickly and confidently.
  * Beyond the Makers Academy curriculum and with no prior mobile development experience, I learned Swift and the Xcode IDE sufficiently well to prototype a native iOS application in three days.

##### Examples
| Project | Team Size | Description | Technologies |
|---------|:---------:|-------------|--------------|
|[Moments](https://github.com/BjoernWagner/moments) | 5 | Makers Academy final project. A social mobile app that allows people to share and view experiences on a map, updated in real-time. | Swift, Xcode, Firebase, AWS S3, Facebook SDK (iOS), XCTest, Quick |
|[GithubCreep](https://github.com/BjoernWagner/github-creep) | 4 | A single-page application for searching GitHub user profiles via JSON requests. | AngularJS, Github API, Protractor, Karma |

#### Teamwork
I have over eight years of professional and volunteer work experience building, leading and working on teams across various industries. Whether pair-programming or collaborating as part of a larger group, I recognize the essential benefits of teamwork and continuously strive to learn from, support and openly share ideas and opinions with my teammates.

##### Examples
- As a member of several project teams at Makers Academy, I worked with other students to define tasks, establish Git workflows and merge completed tickets into singular MVP codebases.
- I recruited and managed a volunteer team responsible for contributing data analysis and visualization to UN OCHA's $408M revised regional appeal for Libya (2011).
- Together with other senior technicians and management at New York University, I prioritized and delegated support tickets to junior staff, minimizing ticket response times and critical service downtime.
- As a Core Team member at the Standby Task Force, I resolved a long-stalled incorporation process by working directly with our lawyers and creating more transparent and inclusive channels of communication with our base of 1,200+ volunteers.
